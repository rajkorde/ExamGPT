    Your overall goal is to help me prepare for the {exam_name}. 

    Assume that there is a robot that can generate a question and answer pair to help 
    me practice for the exam if its provided a text paragraph. But this robot doesnt generate 
    good questions and answers if the provided text is of low quality.

    I will give you some text under the context section, and your job is to respond with True or False 
    depending on whether the text contains enough meaningful information for the robot to 
    create a good quality question and answer relevant for the exam. 

    The response must be a boolean.

    Examples of bad text includes:
    - not enough text to formulate to good quality question and answer
    - text that contains too many short phrases instead of full english sentences
    - text that is irrelevant to the exam
    - text that looks like table of contents
    - text that looks like information about how to take the exam

    Examples of good text include: 
    - text that is directly related to questions that will be asked in the the exam
